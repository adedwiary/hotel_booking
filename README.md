# Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to reduce hotel booking cancellations by leveraging data-driven insights. By analyzing historical booking data, we identified key factors contributing to cancellations and developed predictive models and segmentation strategies to mitigate them. The final deliverables include predictive analytics using logistic regression, customer segmentation with K-Means clustering, and an interactive Tableau dashboard for real-time decision-making.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze hotel booking data to uncover the primary drivers of cancellations.
- Develop and apply logistic regression models to predict and reduce cancellation likelihood.
- Segment customers based on booking behavior using K-Means clustering.
- Build an interactive Tableau dashboard to present insights and enable real-time business decisions.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Google Colab): Data preprocessing, analysis, modeling (logistic regression, clustering)
- **Google Sheets**: Initial data exploration and manipulation
- **Tableau**: Interactive dashboard for data visualization
- **Google Slides**: Presentation of findings and strategic recommendations

## 🔍 Key Tasks
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on hotel booking records
- Built a logistic regression model to classify and predict booking cancellations
- Applied K-Means clustering to segment customers by behavioral patterns
- Designed a Tableau dashboard to visualize insights and support stakeholder decision-making

## 📈 Results & Impact
- Reduced overall cancellation rate from **36% to 22%** within six months
- Achieved **15% increase in engagement and bookings** from budget-conscious travelers
- Enhanced customer satisfaction and repeat bookings through targeted retention strategies
